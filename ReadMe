# The Prediction Task 
Goal : **predict future events** (AIDs) for each **session** in the test data **after the last timestamp**

- **AID (Article ID)** represents an **item or product ID** in the dataset.
- It refers to the **specific product a user interacts with** (clicks, adds to cart, or orders).


- The test dataset consists of **sessions that have been truncated at a certain timestamp**.
- This means you only see the **beginning/middle** of each session, but the remaining part (future interactions) is **missing**.
- Your goal is to **predict what happens next** in that session.


For each **session**, you need to predict **the next AID(s) that the user will interact with**, depending on the event type:

#### **🔹 Clicks Prediction**
- You must **predict the next AID** that will be clicked.
- However, you are allowed to **predict up to 20 candidates**, ranked by probability.
- **Ground Truth:** The actual next clicked AID.

#### **🔹 Carts Prediction**
- You must **predict all AIDs that will be added to the cart** after the truncation point.
- The ground truth can contain **multiple** AIDs.

#### **🔹 Orders Prediction**
- You must **predict all AIDs that will be ordered** after the truncation point.
- Again, the ground truth can contain **multiple** AIDs.

### **4️ Example**
#### **🔹 Given Session (Before Truncation)**
| Timestamp | Event Type | AID  |
|-----------|------------|------|
| 100       | click      | 123  |
| 105       | click      | 456  |
| 110       | add_to_cart | 789  |

- The session is **truncated at timestamp 110**.
- You do **not** see what happens next.
- Your job is to **predict what happens after timestamp 110**.

#### **🔹 Ground Truth (Hidden Future Events)**
| Timestamp | Event Type | AID  |
|-----------|------------|------|
| 115       | click      | 555  |
| 120       | add_to_cart | 999  |
| 125       | order      | 999  |

- **Clicks Prediction:** You should **predict AID 555** as the next click.
- **Carts Prediction:** You should **predict AID 999** as being added to cart.
- **Orders Prediction:** You should **predict AID 999** as being ordered.

### **5️⃣ How to Make Predictions?**
- **Historical Trends:** Look at what AIDs were clicked before truncation and predict likely next clicks.
- **Session-Based Recommendations:** Use the session’s past interactions to infer what AIDs may be added to cart or ordered.
- **Popularity-Based Methods:** If no session history is available, predict the most popular AIDs in the dataset.

### **🚀 Summary**
| Event Type | What to Predict? | How Many? | Ground Truth |
|------------|-----------------|------------|--------------|
| **Clicks** | Next clicked AID | Up to 20 | Only **1** correct answer |
| **Carts** | AIDs added to cart | Up to 20 | Multiple possible correct answers |
| **Orders** | AIDs ordered | Up to 20 | Multiple possible correct answers |

Your goal is to **predict what AIDs occur after the truncation timestamp for each session**.
